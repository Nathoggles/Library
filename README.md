A Library web app, which allows to add custom book cards (containing key publishing data) and to build book lists/collections. 
For that, the JavaScript code relies on object constructors and DOM manipulation and stores all books in an array. It allows to add and delete books from the library dynamically.
The project will serve as a base for a further expansion to include database storage and sorting.
